## Implementation Strategy

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Foundation must be solid before building features
2. **Implement in order** - Each phase builds on previous phases
3. **Test as you go** - Don't wait until the end to test
4. **Use migrations** - Version control your database changes
5. **Follow schema** - Stick closely to SCHEMA.md definitions

### Key Decisions to Make

1. **Auto-increment IDs**

    - Use default ID for all primary keys

2. **Role-Permission Package**

    - Custom implementation recommended (matches schema exactly)
    - Spatie package is great but doesn't match schema structure

3. **File Storage**

    - Already have FileHandlerService ✅
    - Use for hotel/room images

4. **Frontend Framework**
    - Current: Blade templates with DataTables ✅
    - No separate frontend needed - Laravel handles everything

## Technical Notes

### Database Conventions

-   All timestamps: created_at, updated_at
-   Soft deletes: Use deleted_at where appropriate

### Permission Checking Pattern

```php
// Check permission before action
if (!auth()->user()->hasPermission('hotels.create')) {
    abort(403);
}

// Check hotel access
if (!auth()->user()->hasAccessToHotel($hotelId)) {
    abort(403);
}

// Check admin override
if ($room->hasAdminReservation()) {
    abort(403, 'Room is reserved by admin');
}
```

### Status Change Pattern

```php
// When changing room status
$room->update(['status' => 'occupied']);
RoomStatusHistory::create([
    'room_id' => $room->id,
    'previous_status' => 'reserved',
    'new_status' => 'occupied',
    'changed_by' => auth()->id(),
]);
```
